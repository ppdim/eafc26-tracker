# EA FC26 Offline Tracker v3.1 (patch)
Fixes:
- KPI block uses CSS grid so the frame doesn't misalign on long labels.
- Aggregation now groups competitive matches by **competition name** if present **else by mode**, so Champions (WL), Live Events, Tournaments, Gauntlets — and Rivals — appear.
- Tournament picker shows every group; clicking a row selects it.
- "Matches of selected event" section lists all matches for that group.
- Competition name field is available for **Champions** and **Gauntlets** (not only Tournaments/Live Events).
- Full RU/EN switcher for visible titles/buttons/placeholders.

Usage: open `index.html` in your browser.
